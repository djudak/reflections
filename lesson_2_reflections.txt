-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The directory is added to my git repo- it receives a hidden file that contains all versions of my files in this directory.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Files are first added to the staging area. A commit includes these files in the staging area. The value it offers is that its not that easy to accidentally commit something.

-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When a project has to be extended, e.g. a finished, working program is to be expanded with a new feature. Having branches would make sure that the overall project remains accessible while also providing a backlog for the new feature without requiring it be standalone.
