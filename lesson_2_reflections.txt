-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The directory is added to my git repo- it receives a hidden file that contains all versions of my files in this directory.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Files are first added to the staging area. A commit includes these files in the staging area. The value it offers is that its not that easy to accidentally commit something.

-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When a project has to be extended, e.g. a finished, working program is to be expanded with a new feature. Having branches would make sure that the overall project remains accessible while also providing a backlog for the new feature without requiring it be standalone.

-How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps to see which nodes/branches have parents and which ones don't. Thus, detecting 'orphan' branches that cannot be reached becomes easy.

- What is the result of merging two branches together?
The individual commits of both branches become intertwined according to their timestamps. 

- Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Because the diagram can show how the merge commit has two parents, how it becomes the new head of the master branch and it also allows for the commits to be placed on a timeline.
