What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The directory is added to my git repo- it receives a hidden file that contains all versions of my files in this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Files are first added to the staging area. A commit includes these files in the staging area. The value it offers is that its not that easy to accidentally commit something.
